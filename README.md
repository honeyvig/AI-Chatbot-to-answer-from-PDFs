# AI-Chatbot-to-answer-from-PDFs
I am building an AI-powered chatbot. There are roughly 7 separate 10 - 100 page PDFs each being the policy for lending from different banks. I would like the bot to be able to answer questions about these PDFs, even comparing their policies. What would be the method and steps to building a strong intelligent chatbot with a great user experience based on these PDFs.

We have had multiple attempts at building this and so far it is riddled with errors, non-sense answers, incorrect flow of conversation.
=====================
To build an effective and intelligent chatbot capable of accurately answering questions and comparing information from multiple PDFs, you’ll need a structured approach that combines robust preprocessing, embedding-based search, and fine-tuned conversational AI. Here's how you can achieve this:
1. Pipeline Overview
Step 1: Preprocess the PDFs

    Extract text from PDFs and preprocess it (remove extra whitespace, convert to a uniform case, tokenize paragraphs or sentences).
    Use libraries like PyPDF2, pdfminer, or PyMuPDF.

Step 2: Split Text into Manageable Chunks

    Break the text into logical chunks (e.g., paragraphs or sections).
    Use tools like LangChain or custom logic for splitting while retaining context.

Step 3: Generate Embeddings

    Generate vector embeddings for each text chunk using models like OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 or Hugging Face’s sentence-transformers.
    Store these embeddings in a vector database like Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS.

Step 4: Question-Answering Pipeline

    Accept user queries and convert them into embeddings.
    Search the vector database for the most relevant chunks.
    Pass the retrieved context along with the query to a Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT-4 to generate a response.

Step 5: Enhance User Experience

    Implement a conversation flow with memory using frameworks like LangChain to ensure continuity.
    Provide context-based responses to improve accuracy and coherence.

Python Code Implementation
1. Preprocess the PDFs

import PyPDF2

def extract_text_from_pdfs(pdf_files):
    all_texts = {}
    for file in pdf_files:
        with open(file, 'rb') as pdf:
            reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(pdf)
            text = ""
            for page in reader.pages:
                text += page.extract_text()
            all_texts[file] = text
    return all_texts

pdf_files = ["bank1_policy.pdf", "bank2_policy.pdf", "bank3_policy.pdf"]
pdf_texts = extract_text_from_pdfs(pdf_files)

2. Chunk Text for Embeddings

from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

def split_text_into_chunks(text, chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50):
    splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=chunk_size, chunk_overlap=chunk_overlap)
    chunks = splitter.split_text(text)
    return chunks

chunked_texts = {file: split_text_into_chunks(text) for file, text in pdf_texts.items()}

3. Generate and Store Embeddings

from openai.embeddings_utils import get_embedding
import pinecone

# Initialize Pinecone
pinecone.init(api_key="your-pinecone-api-key", environment="us-west1-gcp")

index = pinecone.Index("policy-embeddings")

def generate_and_store_embeddings(text_chunks, pdf_name):
    for i, chunk in enumerate(text_chunks):
        embedding = get_embedding(chunk, engine="text-embedding-ada-002")
        metadata = {"source": pdf_name, "chunk_index": i}
        index.upsert([(f"{pdf_name}_{i}", embedding, metadata)])

# Generate and store embeddings for each PDF
for pdf_name, chunks in chunked_texts.items():
    generate_and_store_embeddings(chunks, pdf_name)

4. Question-Answering Pipeline

def search_relevant_chunks(query, top_k=3):
    query_embedding = get_embedding(query, engine="text-embedding-ada-002")
    results = index.query(query_embedding, top_k=top_k, include_metadata=True)
    return [result['metadata']['source'] for result in results['matches']], \
           [result['metadata'] for result in results['matches']]

def get_answer(query, context_chunks):
    system_prompt = f"Answer the user's question based on the following context:\n\n{context_chunks}"
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": query}
        ]
    )
    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

query = "What is the maximum loan amount for small businesses?"
relevant_files, relevant_chunks = search_relevant_chunks(query)
answer = get_answer(query, "\n".join(relevant_chunks))
print(answer)

5. Add Conversation Memory and Context (Optional)

Using LangChain:

from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize memory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)

# Initialize conversational retrieval chain
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
qa_chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain(llm=llm, retriever=index.as_retriever(), memory=memory)

# Interact with chatbot
response = qa_chain({"question": query})
print(response['answer'])

Best Practices for High Accuracy

    Preprocessing for Accuracy:
        Remove non-text content like headers/footers.
        Standardize formatting to retain structure.

    Fine-Tune on Domain Data:
        If possible, fine-tune an LLM (like GPT-4 or a similar model) on your policy documents to improve domain-specific accuracy.

    QA Validation:
        Implement human feedback loops to refine and validate answers during testing.

    Handle Ambiguities:
        Allow the bot to clarify questions with the user if the query is ambiguous.

    UX Enhancements:
        Use a frontend framework (e.g., React/Next.js) to provide a clean and intuitive interface.
        Include features like highlighting the source of information and giving confidence scores.

    Scaling for Large Data:
        Use a scalable vector database (like Pinecone or Weaviate) to handle large datasets efficiently.

Challenges and Mitigation

    Ambiguity in PDFs:
        Extract metadata to improve context retrieval.
    Long Responses:
        Summarize responses using an LLM.
    Real-Time Latency:
        Optimize embeddings and caching to improve speed.

By following these steps, you can build a robust chatbot capable of providing accurate, meaningful, and user-friendly answers to questions about bank lending policies.
